This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Inter](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Inter), a clean and modern sans-serif font designed for computer screens.

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for unit testing. Run the tests with:

```bash
npm test
# or
npm run test:watch   # Run in watch mode
```

Tests are located in `__tests__` directories adjacent to the files they test. For example, components in `src/ui/fixtures/` have their tests in `src/ui/fixtures/__tests__/`.

To create a new test file, follow the naming convention: `[filename].test.tsx`.
